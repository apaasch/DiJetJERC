# DiJetJERC
This is module for JER and JEC studies with dijet events. 
It contains:
- UHH2 module for preselection (AnalysisModule_DiJetTrg), which is the same for JER SF and relative L2Res residulas JEC
- Set of scripts for L2Res analysis in L2Res_Analysis
- Set of scripts for JER SF analysis in JERSF_Analysis

This branch is dedicated for Run3 SFs.
The Ntuples are produced in a CMSSW 130X envirmoent.
This branch only works with the dedicated UHH2 branch: https://github.com/UHH2/UHH2/tree/RunII_106X_v2_Run3

Due to historical reasons, set of script and way of running them is different at the moment. 

TBA: add short instruction for each part
